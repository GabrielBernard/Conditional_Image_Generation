This blog will have the purpose to report all the results obtained for my project on Conditional Image Generation (see [About](https://gabrielbernard.github.io/Conditional_Image_Generation/about/) page of this blog for more info) along with designed choices and other justification or information I think is interesting to note.

This will act like a course report interactively updated throughout the semester of my course on Deep Learning.
