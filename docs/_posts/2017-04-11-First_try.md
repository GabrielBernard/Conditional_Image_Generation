# Learning to use Theano and Lasagne
My first attempt to solve the task was a simple convolutional encoder and decoder. It's goal was to try to learn a way to extract the features of the cropped data in order to compute the inner part. The cost function was a simple mean squared error between the computed inner part and the real inner part of each image in the training set. Of course, this approach does not generalize well because the mean square error is not, in my opinion, a good way to measure the realism of a picture. The result where blurry, gray and have a problem of repeating pattern to which I could not find the source. These results are given by the figure bellow.
