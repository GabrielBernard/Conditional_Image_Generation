## Learning to use Theano and Lasagne
My first attempt to solve the task was a simple convolutional encoder and decoder. It's goal was to try to learn a way to extract the features of the cropped data in order to compute the inner part. The cost function was a simple mean squared error between the computed inner part and the real inner part of each image in the training set. Of course, this approach does not generalize well because the mean square error is not, in my opinion, a good way to measure the realism of a picture. The result where blurry, gray and have a problem of repeating pattern. I later found that this pattern was due to an error in the reshaping of the data. In any case, it was sure that this was not the network I could use to generate images considered realistic since it took a lot of training to obtain very poor results.

The results are given by the figure bellow.
