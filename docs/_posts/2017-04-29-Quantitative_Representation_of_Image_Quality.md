No easy quantitative evaluation of the realism of an image can be done. The realism of an image is determined by the appearance, shape, colour of the objects represented in it. Humans recognize if an image is real or fake by the fact that the brains find matching patterns that fits its representation of reality.

Following this though, what makes an image realistic. The fact that it resembles every other conceived objects that the brain already saw in its many years of training. That is why a child would be scared by a scene in an animated movie, but an adult would not. Because the adult brain knows for a fact it does not represent reality since the shape and colours of what is shown on the screen fits an animated movie and not something real.

It is an analogy, but, for me, it explains why the GAN network performs so well and why some may say it is a big step forward in AI. The idea that a network would be made of two parts, one that learns what is fake and the other that learns how to fool the other is really the best way to try to learn how to generate realistic images. In a way, this means that the discriminator of the GAN network learns its own quantitative representation of the realism of an image, and that is the only way to represent one. My thoughts on the matter are as follows. Realistic images only come from the fact that they represent the real world and thousands or millions of parameters have to be taken into account in order to determine if an image is real or not. Since a computer cannot learn in the same way the human brain does (for now), it can only learn through guesses upon images and learn on its own how to represent the features of a real image, and that is why GAN networks are so good.
